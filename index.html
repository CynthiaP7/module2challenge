            <p> Hello! I am Cynthia. Currently, I work as a 3rd Grade teacher at a charter school in the Bronx. I have found myself navigating my interest in technology since I completed my master's in Curriculum Development and Instructional Technology. I look forward to learning to code and become a software engineer through the Software Engineering Bootcamp I enrolled at. My journey, work experiences and accomplishments will all be in this web page. Aside from coding and teaching, I am also a wife and mom to three wonderful boys. I also love to build lego sets and bake! I look forward to sharing my coding experience with you!</p>
